# Imperative to Declarative examples

A set of code solutions to problems, that have been firstly solved using imperative paradigm.
For each of them, a declarative (or a near-to declarative) solution has been proposed, using functional programming.

Since TDD approach has been used, it is possible to explore those solutions by looking at unit test cases.

In order to compile and run the tests:

1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm test`
